## Users’ Manual of TF-TWAS

## Overview
This directory contains how we proccessed Elastic-net training and Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) cross-set association test that used in the paper titled "Integrating prior knowledge of susceptible transcription factors occupied elements with transcriptome-wide association analysis identifies over 150 risk genes in breast cancer".

## Methods
### Elastic-Net training: 
#### Prepare input data: 
**1)	Gene expression file:** 

The fully processed, filtered and normalized gene expression matrices in bed format ("Breast_Mammary_Tissue.v8.normalized_expression.bed") for breast tissue was downloaded from GTEx portal (https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets). We only included 151 female samples in our analysis and generated a new file named "Breast_Mammary_Tissue.v8.normalized_expression.no_sex.female.bed". The covariates used in eQTL analysis, including top five genotyping principal components (PCs), were obtained from GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL_covariates.tar.gz, which was downloaded from GTEx portal (https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets). Then, we further performed a probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) analysis to adjust for top five genotyping PCs, age, and other potential confounding factors (PEERs)[1] for downstream prediction model building. There is a description of how to download and use the PEER tool here: https://github.com/PMBio/peer/wiki/Tutorial. The command that we used is shown as below: 

`Rscript ./code/Peer_Script.R`

According to GTEx protocol, if the number of samples is between 150 and 250, 30 PEER factors should be used. For our study, the number of samples is 151, so we used 30 PEER factors. This command will generate a residual file named “GeneExpression_Breast_Female_AfterRM_Residuals.csv”, and from this residual file, we generated the final gene expression data file named “Breast_Mammary_Tissue.v8.normalized_expression.no_sex.female.rm_covariates.bed” as the input for our downstream predictive model. 

**2)	genotype file:**  
The whole genome sequencing file, GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_WholeGenomeSeq_866Indiv.vcf, was downloaded from dbGaP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v8.p2). The genotype dataset is quality controlled using the tool PLINK [2] (https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/ ). Multiple QC steps were applied by excluding variants with missingness rate > 0.1, minor allele frequency < 0.01, high deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at p<10-6, and removing samples with missingness rate > 0.1.

We prioritized putative regulatory variants based on their associations with breast cancer risk. For variants that bind to only one TF, we used the single TF beta value, and for other variants that bind to more than one TFs, we considered the largest beta values of the paired TFs. Once we obtained the beta values for all TF-occupied elements, we ranked those variants based on the beta values from largest to smallest, which illustrated with more important to less for breast cancer risk. We then compiled six sets of putative regulatory variants by roughly including top 50K, 100K, 200K, 500K, 1M and 1.4M regulatory variants. Within the input genotype file (XXX.breast.female.no_sex.csv), it only includes regulatory variants within +/- 1M of the target gene location. The format of the genotype file looks like below: 

SNP,CHR,LOC,GTEX-1117F,GTEX-1122O,GTEX-11EM3,GTEX-11EMC,GTEX-11GSP,GTEX-11I78, … …

#### Training Elastic Net model:
For each regulatory variant set, we trained the gene-expression prediction model using an elastic-net approach. However, instead of using all flanking genetic variants (flanking ±1Mb region) to train the elastic-net model, like the regular TWAS does, we only included the putative regulatory variants in each set within flanking ±1Mb region of the target gene. For each gene, the gene expression level was regressed on the number of effect alleles (0-2) for each genetic variant with adjustment for top genotyping PCs, age, and other potential confounding factors (PEERs). Once every input file is ready, we processed one gene at a time by executing this code:	

`Rscript ./code/WeightEN_Stratify_GTexv7_New.R  target_gene_id`


### Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) cross-set association test:
In order to combine single-set test results, we adapted existing codes for integrating correlated and sparse signals in multiple tissues provided by UTMOST [3] (https://github.com/Joker-Jerome/UTMOST). First, a covariance matrix was built based on the single-set test results and LD structures are formed, then the GBJ test is carried out. The codes for both steps are shown as below:

**Step 1: Calculate the joint test covariance**

`python /path/to/joint_covariance.py --weight_db weight_db/ --input_folder input_folder/ --covariance_output covariance/`

**Command parameters:**


joint_covariance.py. It's downloaded from https://github.com/Joker-Jerome/UTMOST

weight_db. Name of weight db in data folder.

input_folder. Name of folder containing dosage data.

covariance_output. Path where covariance results will be saved to.


**Step 2: Combine gene-trait associations in variant set models by joint GBJ test**

`python /path/to/joint_GBJ_test.py --weight_db weight_db/ --output_dir result_gbj/ --cov_dir covariance/ --input_folder asso_test/ --gene_info intermediate/gene_info.txt --output_name Func_GBJ_Joint --start_gene_index 1 --end_gene_index 12700\`

**Command parameters:**

joint_GBJ_test.py. It's downloaded from https://github.com/Joker-Jerome/UTMOST

weight_db. Name of weight db in data folder (imputation models).

input_folder. Name of folder containing single-test association results.

cov_dir. Path where covariance results are (covariance matrix for gene-level test statistics across each set).

output_dir. Path where results will be saved to.

gene_info. File containing the all the genes tested.

start_gene_index. Index of the starting gene in intermediate/gene_info.txt.

end_gene_index. Index of the ending gene in intermediate/gene_info.txt.
